# ImmunoChroma GitHub Pages Site

This repository contains the official website for the ImmunoChroma project - a smartphone-based immune response measurement system using colorimetric self-assembled plasmonic biosensors.

## About

ImmunoChroma is a revolutionary point-of-care diagnostic platform that uses plasmonic nanoparticles to detect antibodies through smartphone-based colorimetric analysis. The system offers:

- **Cost-effective**: Low-cost manufacturing using self-assembled aluminum nanoparticles
- **Portable**: No bulky equipment required - works with any smartphone
- **Accurate**: Dynamic range of 10 µg/mL–5 mg/mL with LOD ~4.23 µg/mL
- **User-friendly**: No specialized training required
